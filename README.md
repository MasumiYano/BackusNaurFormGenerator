# BackusNaurFormGenerator
# Program Description 
In this programm I completed a program that reads an inpuit file with a grammar in Backus-Naur Form and allows the user to randomly generate lements of the grammar. I used recursion to implement the core of my algorithm. 

# What's Backus-Naur Form? 
It's is a notation used to describe the syntax and structure of context-free grammars. It is named after its creators, John Backus and Peter Naur.

BNF provides a concise and formal way to represent the rules and production syntax of a programming language, a data format, or any other context that requires precise specifications. It is commonly used in the field of computer science and programming language design.

In BNF notation, a grammar consists of a set of production rules that define the valid syntax and structure of a language. Each rule has a left-hand side (non-terminal) and a right-hand side (a sequence of terminals and non-terminals). The non-terminals represent syntactic categories or placeholders, while terminals represent the actual symbols that appear in the language.
